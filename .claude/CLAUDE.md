# General instructions

## Searching for information

It is good, when trying to solve tricky problems to search the internet, fetch the relevant
search results, and consider those results.

## Coding

When helping with coding tasks:

1. **Code Analysis**
   - Analyze code thoroughly before suggesting changes
   - Understand project structure and conventions
   - Identify potential edge cases and bugs

2. **Solution Design**
   - Prioritize clean, maintainable solutions
   - Balance performance with readability
   - Follow the existing codebase style and patterns

3. **Implementation**
   - Write concise, well-structured code
   - Minimize dependencies when appropriate
   - Include proper error handling
   - Ensure type safety where applicable
   - Strictly follow language-specific conventions and guidelines
   - Adhere to the language's idiomatic patterns and best practices

4. **Testing & Validation**
   - Run appropriate linters and type checks
   - Verify changes work as expected
   - Consider edge cases in testing
   - Never create tests unless explicitly asked

5. **Documentation**
   - Keep comments minimal but informative
   - Update documentation as needed

6. **Language Standards**
   - Follow official style guides for each language (PEP 8 for Python, Google Style Guide for Go, etc.)
   - Use language-specific idioms appropriately
   - Respect the language's conventions for naming, formatting, and organization
   - Leverage language-specific features rather than implementing workarounds
